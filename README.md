#Introduction:
NSTU Food Ordering System is a web-based application intended to provide a platform for 
food entrepreneurs to start their own business. Students would be able to establish themselves 
as entrepreneurs from the beginning of their student life. Also, general students get to have 
delicious home-made food, which ensures both taste and hygiene.
To begin as a food entrepreneur, students must first register in the system and create a profile. 
Food entrepreneursâ€™ profiles will contain a list of foods they offer.
General students will log in as students and they will get to order the food they want. The food 
entrepreneur will be notified about the order and he will deliver the food in person and receive 
payment as both the student and food entrepreneur are on campus.
