# Introduction:
NSTU Food Ordering System is a web-based application intended to provide a platform for 
food entrepreneurs to start their own business. Students would be able to establish themselves 
as entrepreneurs from the beginning of their student life. Also, general students get to have 
delicious home-made food, which ensures both taste and hygiene.
To begin as a food entrepreneur, students must first register in the system and create a profile. 
Food entrepreneurs’ profiles will contain a list of foods they offer.
General students will log in as students and they will get to order the food they want. The food 
entrepreneur will be notified about the order and he will deliver the food in person and receive 
payment as both the student and food entrepreneur are on campus.

# Motivation:
Good food has always been a problem for our university students. Every now and then, students 
have been seen complaining to higher authorities about it. We have a few food stalls, but they 
do not serve good quality food, and they are very costly. Also, the food provided in the dining 
hall is not hygienic.
We have many business-minded people on campus who want to be food entrepreneurs. They 
dream of starting their own business from student life. But they do not get the proper platform 
for that.
To mitigate the food problems of students and the obstacles food entrepreneurs have in their 
way of starting their business, we want to build a platform where both the problems can be 
solved. Food entrepreneurs would be able to start their catering business and students would 
be able to have good food.

# Objectives:
* Creating Web application
* Implementation of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT knowledge
* Implementation of PHP knowledge
* Integrating database and managing database 

# Expected outcomes:
The system is mostly based on our campus so that students can get benefits from it. The
expected outcomes are
1. Students order food online because it’s just so convenient and easy for them. Everything 
is at their fingertips. Just about anyone who has a smartphone or a laptop can use it to 
order food online.
2. Numerous third-party businesses, including Uber Eats and Deliveroo, charge up to 30% 
in fee on each order. There will be some initial costs involved in setting up this food
ordering system for our campus, but once it's up and running, all you'll have to pay is a 
subscription fee and a small transaction fee.
3. They can order whenever they want. Even if a tong is closed, its online food ordering 
service may still remain operational. Students can place orders at any time and select a 
specific delivery or pickup time for when the tong is open while using the online food 
ordering system.
